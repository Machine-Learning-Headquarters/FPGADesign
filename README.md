# FPGADesign
Repo for information on FPGAs. These tend to be "glue logic" and interfaces that are highly specialized or parallelized


Catch all for discussions and designs that require FPGAs. Do interfaces need an FPGA or a CPU? Is it more practical (read cheaper) to use and FPGA or 
to create new silicon for the interface? Would a microcontroller of sufficent speed be able to handle it?


[Has a few resources for FPGA.](<https://digilent.com/blog/can-we-do-better-than-verilog-and-vhdl-for-fpgas/> "FPGA tools") The title is sort of click-baity

[PAL vs CPDL vs FPGA](<https://digilent.com/blog/pal-vs-cpld-vs-fpga/> "Types of programmeable logic devices") This came up in the block diagram for a network switch
