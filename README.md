# FPGADesign
Repo for information on FPGAs. These tend to be "glue logic" and interfaces that are highly specialized or parallelized


Catch all for discussions and designs that require FPGAs. Do interfaces need an FPGA or a CPU? Is it more practical (read cheaper) to use and FPGA or 
to create new silicon for the interface? Would a microcontroller of sufficent speed be able to handle it?
